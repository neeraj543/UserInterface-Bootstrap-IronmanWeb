              <h5 class="card-title"> History</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Iron Man, a Marvel Comics creation, first graced the pages of "Tales of Suspense" in 
                1963, emerging from the brilliant minds of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby. 
                The alter ego of industrialist Tony Stark, Iron Man's origin lies in his ingenuity, as he constructs 
                a powered suit of armor to escape captivity in Vietnam. Evolving from the clunky Mark I to the sleek 
                and advanced suits, Iron Man became a central figure in the Marvel Universe, contributing to the Avengers 
                and facing a diverse array of villains. The character's impactful storylines, such as "Demon in a Bottle" 
                and "Armor Wars," added depth, while the portrayal by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
                propelled Iron Man to global stardom, solidifying his place as a cultural icon with a lasting legacy in 
                comics and film.
                The cinematic portrayal of Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been a cornerstone of the 
                character's global popularity. Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the 
                2008 film "Iron Man" marked the beginning of the MCU, setting a tone for subsequent interconnected superhero
                 movies. Stark's character arc, from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero, unfolds across multiple films,
                  including "Iron Man 2," "The Avengers," and the "Iron Man" sequels. Notable moments, such as the introduction
                   of the Hulkbuster armor and the emotional climax in "Avengers: Endgame," solidify Iron Man as a linchpin in
                    the MCU narrative. The films not only showcase thrilling superhero action but also explore the human side of Tony Stark,
                     making the character a beloved and integral part of the cinematic superhero landscape.</p>
