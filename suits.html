            <h5><a href="https://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Man_Mark_I">Mark 1</a></h5>
            <p>The Mark I (Mark 1), is the first Iron Man suit built and created by Tony Stark.
                 It was built in the initial events of the live-action film, Iron Man. The suit 
                 was later used as a model for Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger suit.

                It was featured in the first Iron Man movie, and first appeared when Tony and Ho
                 Yinsen were held captive by the terrorist group known as the Ten Rings. While they
                  were held captive, Tony and Yinsen devised a plan. 
                The suit was very crude, due to the limited tools and resources that were available.

                The suit has several notable functionalities and weapons. It is equipped with a 
                Manually Deployed Rocket Launcher, two Flamethrowers mounted on each arm, Jet Boots
                 equipped in its soles, an exposed Internal System attached to its back, and the very 
                 first Miniature Arc Reactor in the center of its chest. This reactor powers the entire 
                 suit.  </p>

            <h5><a href="https://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_VII">Mark 7</a></h5>
            <p> The Mark VII (Mark 7), is a Fully Loaded Rapid Deployment Suit, and was the seventh suit created by Tony Stark,
                 to surpass the Mark VI, sometime between the events of Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.

                It was featured in The Avengers movie, and made its debut in the movie when Tony was
                 forced to order J.A.R.V.I.S., to get it ready for combat, despite it still being constructed, 
                 to use it in the upcoming battle with the Chitauri Army. 
                
                The suit was built for heavy combat, and was heavily armed with weapons.
                
                The armor has a unique feature that involves forming itself into a large pod, and when opened, 
                had mechanical arms, that could extend and reach onto Tony's arms, grabbing them and quickly 
                wrapping itself around him. This was done through the use of two special metallic bracelets, 
                both of which had encrypted codes embedded within them in the black rectangular spaces.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Machine">War-Machine</a></h5>
            <p>War Machine is the title adopted by James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes after he acquired the War
                 Machine armor. He is a military veteran and pilot who began working for Tony Stark, eventually 
                 discovering that he was Iron Man and then taking Stark's place when he was incapacitated. Stark subsequently 
                 gave Rhodes the War Machine armor. The character is among the earliest African American superheroes
                  in mainstream comics. His race, his military experience, and his sense of morality are often used
                   to contrast him with Tony Stark and to analyze the themes of Iron Man stories through a different
                    perspective. </p>
